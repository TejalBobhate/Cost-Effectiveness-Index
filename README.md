# Cost-Effectiveness-Index 
Objective- Comparing healthcare providers on their relative cost-effectiveness using claims data.
Providers cannot be compared based on single parameter for their high cost considering the complexity of the heathcare delivery and the multifaceted nature of cost effectiveness.
To ensure fair comparisons across diverse practices, performed per capita calculations for each parameter.
All dimensions were reduced to two variables 1) Risk Profile 2) Cost Profile
Risk profile catures the patient demographics and health status. While Cost profile captures the various cost associated with the patient care.
